## Risk Assessment

### Production Readiness: ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT READY**
**Feature Development**: ‚úÖ Can proceed - builds operational
**Production Deployment**: ‚ùå Security items must be resolved first

### Build Status: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL** 
**RESOLVED**: All compilation failures fixed, feature development can proceed
- Android build: ‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**
- iOS build: ‚úÖ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**
- Root cause: Missing domain models completely implemented

### Security Status: üö® **CRITICAL RISK**
- Unencrypted credentials in storage
- No HTTPS certificate pinning  
- Sensitive data exposed in logs

### Performance Status: ‚úÖ **REQUIREMENTS MET**
- ‚úÖ Smart caching system operational (COMPLETED)
- ‚úÖ Can achieve 50ms response time target
- ‚úÖ TTL-based caching strategy implemented

## Sprint Planning Recommendations

### Sprint 1 (Week 1): **EMERGENCY - Restore Build Capability**
**Focus**: Fix critical compilation failures immediately
- üî¥ **URGENT**: TECH-DEBT-BUILD-001 (5-7 days) - Fix compilation failures
  - TECH-DEBT-ARCH-003 - Contact domain models (2-3 days) 
  - TECH-DEBT-ARCH-004 - Invoice domain models (2-3 days)
  - TECH-DEBT-ARCH-005 - Analytics export models (1-2 days)
- Goal: Restore basic Android/iOS build capability

### Sprint 2 (Week 2): Security Critical Items
**Focus**: Address all security blockers after build is restored
- TECH-DEBT-SEC-003 (2-3 days) - Remove debug logging
- TECH-DEBT-SEC-002 (3-5 days) - Certificate pinning
- Begin TECH-DEBT-SEC-001 - Secure storage

### Sprint 3 (Week 3): Security & Architecture Completion
**Focus**: Complete security foundation
- Complete TECH-DEBT-SEC-001 - Secure storage
- Complete TECH-DEBT-ARCH-001 - ViewModel architecture refinement
- Quality gates and testing validation

## Next Actions Required

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Assign critical security items** to Mobile Security Auditor
2. **Begin TECH-DEBT-SEC-003** - Remove debug logging (highest security risk)
3. **Plan security sprint** for Week 1
4. **Review and approve** tech debt item specifications

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)
1. Execute security fixes according to sprint plan
2. Begin architecture implementation
3. Create remaining high/medium priority tech debt items
4. Setup regular tech debt review meetings

### Long-term (Months 2-3)
1. Complete all critical and high priority items
2. Regular assessment against blueprint compliance
3. Establish ongoing tech debt management process
4. Implement continuous compliance monitoring
