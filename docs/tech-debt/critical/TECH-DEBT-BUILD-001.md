# TECH-DEBT-BUILD-001: Compilation Failures from Missing Domain Architecture

**Priority**: Critical
**Category**: Build System  
**Impact**: Complete build failure on Android and iOS, blocking all development
**Estimated Effort**: 5-7 days (includes all architectural gap fixes)
**Assigned Agent**: tech-lead-coordinator

## Problem

The ktlint code style fixes revealed critical architectural gaps that prevent successful compilation across both Android and iOS targets. The project cannot build due to missing domain models, interfaces, and implementation gaps.

### Root Cause Analysis
The ktlint fixes exposed import and reference issues that were previously masked by wildcard imports and poor code organization. Now that imports are explicit and properly ordered, the compiler can clearly identify missing dependencies.

### Critical Build Blockers

#### Compilation Error Summary
- **AppServices.kt**: 20+ unresolved references to missing interfaces
- **ContactApiImpl.kt**: 80+ type inference and implementation errors  
- **BackendAnalyticsRepository.kt**: Interface implementation failures
- **BackendContactRepository.kt**: Missing domain model references
- **InvoiceApi.kt**: Serialization errors from missing models

#### Missing Architecture Components
1. **Domain Interfaces**: ContactCache, InvoiceCache, Repository contracts
2. **Domain Models**: ContactType, TaxDetails, BankingDetails, TemplateInfo, RecurringInfo
3. **API Models**: CreateContactRequest, UpdateContactRequest, ExportResponse
4. **Shared Utilities**: DateRange, ReportType, ExportFormat enums

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Domain Foundation (2-3 days)
**Prerequisite for any compilation success**
- Implement DateRange shared utility (TECH-DEBT-ARCH-005)  
- Create missing Contact domain models (TECH-DEBT-ARCH-003)
- Create missing Invoice domain models (TECH-DEBT-ARCH-004)
- Create Analytics export models (TECH-DEBT-ARCH-005)

### Phase 2: Repository & Interface Alignment (1-2 days)
**Fix service layer integration**
- Define proper InvoiceRepository and ContactRepository interfaces
- Implement missing InvoiceCache and ContactCache interfaces  
- Update AppServices.kt to use correct repository instantiation
- Ensure all repository implementations match their interfaces

### Phase 3: API Layer Completion (1-2 days)
**Complete API implementations**  
- Fix ContactApiImpl.kt type inference issues
- Implement missing abstract methods in ContactApiImpl
- Add proper serialization annotations to all models
- Ensure RPC endpoints match implementation signatures

### Phase 4: Build Validation (0.5 days)
**Comprehensive build testing**
- Validate Android compilation succeeds
- Validate iOS compilation succeeds  
- Run quality gates to ensure no regressions
- Verify all repository integrations function properly

## Current Build Status
- **Android**: ❌ **FAILED** - 100+ compilation errors
- **iOS**: ❌ **FAILED** - Same compilation errors (shared codebase)
- **Quality Gates**: ✅ **PASSING** - Code style is perfect
- **Root Cause**: Missing domain architecture, not code quality

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Android build: `make android-build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] iOS build: `make ios-framework` succeeds without errors
- [ ] Quality gates: `make quality-check` continues to pass
- [ ] All repository services instantiate correctly in AppServices
- [ ] All API implementations compile without type inference errors
- [ ] No unresolved references across the entire codebase

## Dependencies & Coordination
This is a **coordination task** requiring multiple specialized fixes:
- **TECH-DEBT-ARCH-003**: Contact domain models → kmp-mobile-expert
- **TECH-DEBT-ARCH-004**: Invoice domain models → kmp-mobile-expert  
- **TECH-DEBT-ARCH-005**: Analytics export models → kmp-mobile-expert
- **Integration work**: Repository alignment → backend-integration-specialist

## Impact Assessment
**Current Impact**: **SEVERE** - No development possible until resolved
**Business Impact**: Blocking all feature development and testing
**Timeline Impact**: Every day of delay affects delivery schedule

## Risk Mitigation
- Break work into smallest possible increments for parallel execution
- Focus on compilation success first, functionality refinement second
- Maintain quality gate standards throughout implementation
- Test builds continuously during implementation

## Testing Requirements
- Build validation on both platforms after each phase
- Repository instantiation validation
- API endpoint accessibility verification
- Serialization/deserialization validation for all new models
